# Jenkins---GitHub---Docker-Pipeline
This Jenkins Pipeline pipeline is designed to automate the process of building a Docker image from a specific Git repository and pushing that image to Docker Hub. 

🚀 **Sample NodeJS Application CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker, and Docker Hub 🌐**

**Overview:**
This project aims to automate the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process for a Node.js application using Jenkins, Docker, and Docker Hub. 
By following these steps, you can streamline the development and deployment of your Node.js projects.

**Key Components:**
- Sample Node.js Application
- GitHub Account
- Dockerfile for Building Docker Images
- Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD Automation
- Docker Hub Account
- Ubuntu Server with Jenkins and Docker Installed

**Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD Automation 🤖**
The Jenkins Pipeline implemented in this project is designed to automate the following process:

1. **Build**: Automatically build a Docker image from your Node.js application source code.
2. **Test**: Run tests or other quality checks on the built Docker image.
3. **Push**: Push the Docker image to your Docker Hub account for easy access and distribution.
4. **Deploy**: Optionally, deploy the application in your preferred environment.

**Usage:**
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local development environment.

2. Configure your Jenkins server to set up the pipeline job, and link it to your GitHub repository.

3. Customize the Dockerfile to suit your Node.js application's requirements.

4. Configure Jenkins to work with your Docker Hub account for image pushing.

5. As you make changes to your Node.js application, Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline to build, test, and push the updated Docker image to Docker Hub.

6. Deploy the application wherever desired, knowing you have a streamlined CI/CD pipeline in place.

📁 **Repository Structure:**
- `Dockerfile`: Define the Docker image build instructions.
- `Jenkinsfile`: Configure the Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD.
- `app/`: Your Node.js application source code.
- `tests/`: Test scripts or test-related resources.
